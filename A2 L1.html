     <p class="onli-sub"><strong>Review</strong></p>
     <p>A gorgeous and well-honed remake of one of the biggest boppers in the PlayStation pantheon, The Last of Us Part I is the best way to play â€“ or replay â€“ Naughty Dogâ€™s esteemed survival classic. The striking improvements it makes to its completely rebuilt world are complemented by the subtle refinements of its charactersâ€™ performances, and while it isnâ€™t retrofitted with every one of the sequelâ€™s best changes, the upgrades to movement and AI make a welcome difference in an already outstanding game. Itâ€™s harder to argue it was an entirely crucial remake, though, considering 2014â€™s The Last of Us Remastered still stands head and shoulders above nearly all of its story-driven, action-adventure peers to this day.</p>
