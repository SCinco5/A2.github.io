     <p class="onli-sub"><strong>Review</strong></p>
     <p>As someone who's played every single Call of Duty campaign and really missed it last year, the new Modern Warfare is exactly the kind of single-player revival I've been looking for. It introduces welcome new kinds of gameplay moments while executing familiar ones exceptionally well. Sure, its story may not be as provocative as it seems to want to be, but it reestablishes a strong identity for this 16-year-old franchise with a showcase solo shooter experience. Amidst a growing pile of battle royales and looter shooters that just don't scratch that same itchy trigger finger, it felt just like old times.</p>
