     <p>Taking place almost two years after Marvel's Spider-Man, the game's narrative features the two Spider-Men, Peter Parker and Miles Morales, as they come into conflict with Kraven the Hunter, a mercenary leader and big-game hunter who transforms New York City into a sprawling hunting ground for its superhuman populace, including the Spider-Men and their adversaries. Matters are complicated further when an extraterrestrial symbiote called Venom bonds itself to Peter, negatively altering his personality and threatening to dismantle his personal relationships.</p>

     <p class="onli-sub"><strong>Review</strong></p>
     <p>As a sequel in a spectacular series, Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is both blessed and cursed. Its story of two Spider-Men is a great time and a Spidey fan's dream to play through as comic book pages are brought to life, elegantly walking the tightrope between light humour and heavier themes. Meanwhile, Insomniac refines a successful formula of combat and web-swinging without revolutionising either in major ways, making them comfy and familiar with just enough new tweaks and abilities to elevate them to fun new heights. The part that feels like it actually needed a radical rethinking is the open world of New York City, which has been made bigger but not better, with an exhausting checklist of mostly repetitious side activities. But it's safe to call this another thrilling Spider-Man adventure that delivers Insomniac's best tale yet, and despite its open world falling short, it's a reliably fun superhero power trip. And, you know what? Screw it. It really did make me feel like Spider-Man, too.</p>
